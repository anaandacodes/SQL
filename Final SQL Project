#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE title LIKE 'Sales%Agent'

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, i.invoiceid FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT c.firstname AS customer_first, c.lastname AS customer_last, c.country , i.total AS invoice_total, e.firstname AS employee_first, e.lastname AS employee_last
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c 
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices 
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total) FROM invoices 
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.invoicelineid FROM invoice_items i
JOIN tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name AS track, a.name AS artist, i.invoicelineid FROM invoice_items i
JOIN tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid
JOIN artists a
ON a.artistid = al.artistid
JOIN albums al
ON al.albumid = t.albumid

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

JOIN artists ar
ON ar.artistid = al.artistid
JOIN media_types m
ON m.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid
JOIN genres g

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales' FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid

WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS 'Earned Most $ in 2009' FROM employees e 
JOIN customers c

JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
AND e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
